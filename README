We implement a distributed bank system based on Chandy-Lamport global snapshot algorithm in Python by using Multiprocessing. It takes a consistent-global snapshot of all participating nodes which contains both the individual state of each node and the individual state of each communication channel.

The master.py includes all methods we need in our system. The operation of all nodes is defined in node.py. The arg.txt records a test case we input to our system. More test cases can be found in this folder.

How to run: python master.py arg.txt
